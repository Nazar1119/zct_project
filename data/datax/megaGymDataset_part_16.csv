609,Hand shift plank,The hand shift plank is a progression of the straight-arm plank exercise where you maintain a plank position as you shift your hands side to side. The additional movement forces the core muscles to work harder to stabilize.,Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,
610,Cross-body plank march,"The cross-body plank march is an exercise targeting the entire core but especially the obliques. It’s more difficult than a standard plank, with the extra stabilization challenge of bringing one knee at a time off the ground toward the opposing elbow. This will increase the challenge to the core and shoulder muscles, but also present a coordination and balance challenge.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,
611,Bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction,"The bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction is an advanced exercise that combines the isometric stabilization of the Copenhagen plank with dynamic adductions to challenge the core stabilizers and adductors. This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank or Copenhagen plank first.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,

This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor.

620,Medicine ball rotational throw,"The medicine ball rotational throw is an explosive exercise targeting the abdominals, including the obliques, as well as the hips and upper back.
