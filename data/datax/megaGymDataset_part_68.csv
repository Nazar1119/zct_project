2444,Single-arm banded landmine press,"The single-arm banded landmine press is an upper-body exercise that uses an angled barbell anchored at floor level in a landmine device. It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. The band adds constant tension and dynamic resistance to the exercise. The movement focuses primarily on the muscles of the shoulders or deltoids and can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges or for higher reps.",Strength,Shoulders,Bands,Intermediate,,
2445,Band front raise rear fly row combo,"The band front raise rear fly row combo is a combination of three different shoulder exercises to build and strengthen the anterior, middle deltoids, and posterior portions of the shoulders. It requires a continuous loop band to provide constant, dynamic tension throughout the movement. In addition to the front and rear delts, this exercise works the arms, chest, back, and core, making it a great time-efficient shoulder burnout or accessory movement on an upper-body day.",Strength,Shoulders,Bands,Intermediate,,

2462,Overhead bar front raise,"The overhead bar front raise is an exercise targeting the muscles of the traps (trapezius), especially the upper traps, as well as the front or anterior shoulders. It can also be performed with a weight plate or dumbbell, providing a neutral grip that may be more shoulder-friendly for some lifters. Overhead raises are most common for high reps (at least 8-12 reps per set or higher) on a shoulder, trap, or other upper-body-focused muscle-building day.",Strength,Shoulders,Barbell,Intermediate,7.2,Average
2463,Incline barbell shoulder protraction,"The incline barbell shoulder protraction is an upper-body movement that targets strength and mobility in the scapula or shoulder blades. This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.",Strength,Shoulders,Barbell,Intermediate,6.5,Average
2464,Behind-the-head push-press,The behind-the-head push-press is an overhead press variation in which the barbell starts in the back rack position and is pushed overhead with assistance from the lower body.
