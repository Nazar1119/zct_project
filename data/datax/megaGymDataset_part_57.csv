1937,Single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift,"The single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift is a movement targeting the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and back. The difference between a Romanian deadlift and a stiff-legged deadlift is the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support.",Strength,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,Intermediate,,
