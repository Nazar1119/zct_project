2001,Hex-bar deadlift,"The hex bar deadlift is a variety of deadlift performed in a hexagonal barbell also known as a trap bar. The bar is held with a parallel (palms in) grip outside of the legs. It is biomechanically different from a barbell deadlift in that it lines up with a lifter's center of gravity, rather than placing the weight in front of their body. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstrings, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip.",Strength,Quadriceps,Other,Intermediate,8.8,Average

2011,Barbell squat with plate slide,"The barbell squat with plate slide is an exercise targeting the quadriceps, with the plate slide also working the adductors and abductors.
