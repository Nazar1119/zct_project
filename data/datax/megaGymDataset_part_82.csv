2887,Feet-elevated bench dip,"The feet-elevated bench dip is a popular bodyweight exercise for building the triceps, chest, and shoulders. Elevating the feet brings more chest and shoulder into the movement, but also allows for extra weight on the hips.

2888,Bodyweight triceps press,The bodyweight triceps press is an arm movement that involves performing overhead presses in a face-down position on a Smith machine or other raised bar.

2897,Banded dip,"The banded dip is a bodyweight exercise targeting the chest, triceps, and shoulders.

No need to chase a 1RM on this move!",Strength,Triceps,E-Z Curl Bar,Intermediate,9.0,Average
