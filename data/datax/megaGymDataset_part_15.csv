It can be performed for reps or time, either as part of an ab-focused workout or as a component of a circuit workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,

566,Crab walk,"The crab walk is a full-body exercise that has been popular in schools and gym classes for decades.

568,Hang from bar,"The hang from bar is a static exercise that involves hanging from a bar by two hands. It can either be an ""active hang,"" where you pack the shoulders and activate the muscles of the upper back, or a ""passive hang,"" where you let the shoulders unpack and let the muscles of the upper body stretch. A passive hang may not be appropriate for all people depending on their shoulder health, but many coaches believe hanging can be healthy for the shoulders when done properly.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,
