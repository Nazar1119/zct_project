2525,Dumbbell front raise to lateral raise,"The dumbbell front raise to lateral raise is a dumbbell complex that combines two exercises that build and strengthen the middle deltoids and the anterior deltoids of the shoulders. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.).

2529,Standing dumbbell shoulder press,"The standing dumbbell shoulder press is a classic deltoid-building exercise that is common in gyms around the world.
