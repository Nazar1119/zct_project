290,Plank walk-out,"The plank walk-out is an advanced plank variation targeting the core and shoulders. From a standing position, the lifter descends into a plank-type position but “walks” the hands forward until they are out in front of the head.

292,Long sit-up,"The long sit-up is an advanced version of the sit-up exercise that is performed with the hands reaching over the head.

293,FYR Breakdancer,"The side kick-through is a full-body movement that involves isometric holds and moving the body through different ranges of motion, beginning in a bear crawl position.

299,Plank reach,"The plank reach is an exercise targeting the entire core, particularly the oblique muscles.

300,Eiffel Tower leg raise,"The Eiffel Tower leg raise is a bodyweight exercise targeting the muscles of the abs, the rectus abdominis or “six-pack” muscles in particular.

302,Plank up-down,"The plank up-down is a variation of the plank push-up that ends in an elbow plank rather than with the chest on the ground.

It can be performed for time or reps in any bodyweight workout or during the core-focused portion of any workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,
303,Frog kick,"The frog kick is an explosive bodyweight movement that involves hopping the rear legs up and forward from a straight-arm plank position. It targets the legs, core, and shoulders, but is also a high-intensity conditioning movement that will raise core body temperature and burn serious calories. It can be performed for time or reps as part of any athleticism-focused or fat-loss circuit or workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,
304,FYR Knees to Chest,"The hollow-body alternating knee-to-chest is a core exercise that involves bending the legs while holding the hips and shoulder blades off the ground.

There are many ways to perform this movement: strict or swinging, arms completely straight or slightly bent, legs straight or bent, each providing unique benefits and challenges. Initially, it may be a difficult move to do for a single rep, but once you build the requisite core, lat, and shoulder strength, it can be performed for higher reps.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,
