1550,Deadlift - Gethin Variation,"The barbell deadlift is a compound exercise used to develop overall strength and size in the posterior chain. It is a competition lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also considered a classic benchmark of overall strength. When performed with the hands outside the knees, it is often called a ""conventional"" deadlift. When the feet are wide and the hands are inside the knees, it is a sumo deadlift.",Strength,Lower Back,Barbell,Intermediate,,
1551,Barbell good morning,"The barbell good morning is an exercise that targets glute, hamstring, and lower back development. It is often trained as an accessory movement to the deadlift, but also has value on its own. It is sometimes performed for reps in traditional strength-focused rep ranges such as 5-8 reps per set, but due to the risk posed to the lower back, is rarely treated as a max-effort single-rep lift.",Strength,Lower Back,Barbell,Intermediate,,

It is a competition lift in the sport of powerlifting, but is also considered a classic benchmark of overall strength.

1554,FYR Sumo Deadlift High Pull,"The kettlebell sumo deadlift high pull is a dynamic kettlebell exercise that focuses on the muscles of the posterior chain, including the hamstrings, glutes, traps, rear delts, and upper back. It can be done in lower reps for power or strength, or higher reps for conditioning and fat loss. It can also be a component of a circuit-style kettlebell workout, either for time or reps.",Strength,Lower Back,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,
1555,Kettlebell deadlift,"The kettlebell deadlift is a foundational movement in kettlebell training. It's often taught as a buildup or regression to the kettlebell swing, as well as to instruct the ""hip hinge"" motion in a more approachable manner than with a barbell.",Strength,Lower Back,Kettlebells,Intermediate,,

1562,Dumbbell skier,"As the name suggests, the dumbbell skier takes the motion of skiing and replaces the poles with dumbbells. The hip and torso motion are similar to a kettlebell swing, as are the muscles it targets, including the hamstrings, glutes, upper back, and grip. However, unlike the traditional kettlebell swing, the arms are outside of the knees. This movement can be performed for time or for reps, but is usually performed for relatively high reps, such as 8-12 sets per rep or more, as part of a fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout.",Strength,Lower Back,Dumbbell,Intermediate,,
1563,TBS Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift,"The dumbbell stiff-legged deadlift targets the hamstrings, glutes, low and upper back, as well as the core.

1573,Dumbbell kickstand deadlift,"The dumbbell kickstand deadlift is a movement targeting the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and back. The kickstand position can help focus the stretch and contraction on each individual leg, similar to a single-leg Romanian deadlift, while presenting less of a balance challenge. It can be performed in low reps, such as 5-8 reps per set, for strengthening the posterior chain, or for higher reps for muscle growth.",Strength,Lower Back,Dumbbell,Intermediate,,
1574,Single-leg stiff-legged deadlift to row,"The single-leg stiff-legged deadlift to row takes two popular strength moves and combines them into one full-body blaster. Between the deadlift and the row, you'll target the glutes, hamstrings, quads, back, and biceps. Because balance can be a challenge, this movement is usually done with relatively light weights for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.",Strength,Lower Back,Dumbbell,Intermediate,,

1583,Rack Pull - Gethin Variation,"The rack pull is a variation of the deadlift performed from an elevated height, either using boxes, safety pins, or the safeties in a squat rack. It targets all the same muscles as the deadlift, including the glutes, hamstrings, upper back, lower back, and grip. It can e used to strengthen deadlift lockout, but also as a deadlift alternative for people who can’t deadlift from the floor without pain.",Strength,Lower Back,Other,Intermediate,,
1584,Hex Bar Deadlift - Gethin Variation,"The hex bar deadlift is a variety of deadlift performed in a hexagonal barbell also known as a trap bar. The bar is held with a parallel (palms in) grip outside of the legs. It is biomechanically different from a barbell deadlift in that it lines up with a lifter’s center of gravity, rather than placing it in front of their body. The trap bar deadlift can be trained in traditional strength and muscle-focused rep range, or for higher reps. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstring, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip.",Strength,Lower Back,Other,Intermediate,,
