1286,Medicine ball duck walk,"The medicine ball duck walk is a dynamic medicine ball movement that challenges both the upper and lower body, while also elevating the heart rate.

1287,Exercise ball hip thrust,"The exercise ball hip thrust is a simple yet effective way to work the glutes and hamstrings. Proper form is essential to really feel the burn in the glutes, and the ball can help guide you into the right form better than a bench, which is the usual support for hip thrusts.

It can be an excellent component of a warm-up for lower-body training, or a glute activation drill performed anytime.",Strength,Glutes,Exercise Ball,Intermediate,7.8,Average
