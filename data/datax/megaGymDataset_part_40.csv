1402,Glute ham raise-,"The glute ham raise is an exercise targeting the glutes and hamstrings on a GHD, or glute ham developer bench. The unassisted version of the movement requires serious hamstring strength, so it is more common to see versions that use a band or PVC pipe for assistance. It is commonly performed as an accessory movement for heavy barbell lifts. While a single rep may be a struggle at first, with time, strong athletes can build up to doing them for 8-12 reps per set.",Strength,Hamstrings,None,Beginner,9.1,Average

1410,Band-assisted pull-up,"The band-assisted pull-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with an elastic band looped around the feet or knees. This reduces weight and resistance at the bottom of the rep, while increasing it toward the top. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, and is often used as a way to help people boost their pull-up numbers or perform their first rep.",Strength,Lats,Bands,Intermediate,7.6,Average
1411,Assisted Chin-Up,"The reverse-grip chin-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with the palms facing toward the body, in an underhand position, with a band looped around the feet or knees. This reduces weight and resistance at the bottom of the rep, while increasing it toward the top. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand band-assisted pull-ups.",Strength,Lats,Bands,Beginner,0.0,Average

1418,Bent-arm barbell pull-over,"The bent-arm barbell pull-over was a staple exercise of the ""Golden Era"" of bodybuilding and a favorite of Arnold Schwarzenegger himself.

1419,Barbell pull-over to press,"The barbell pull-over to press is a complex that combines two popular exercises into one sequence that works much of the upper body, particularly the chest, triceps, and serratus anterior muscles. It is commonly performed with an EZ-bar, but can also be performed with a straight bar or neutral-grip bar. Because the pull-over will determine the amount of weight you can use, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body portion of a workout.",Strength,Lats,Barbell,Beginner,0.0,
1420,Single-arm barbell bent-over row,"The single-arm barbell bent-over row is a barbell exercise focused on the muscles of the middle back, such as the lats (latissimus dorsi) and rhomboids.
