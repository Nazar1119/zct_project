It can be performed for reps or time, either as part of an ab-focused workout or as a component of a circuit workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,

387,Hanging crunch,"The hanging crunch an abdominal exercise that targets the rectus abdominis or ""six-pack"" muscles. It can be performed hanging from a bar, on a dip station or parallel bars, or if grip strength is a limitation, by placing the elbows in ab straps. If hanging from a straight bar is uncomfortable to the wrists or shoulders, you can also perform them hanging with a neutral grip (palms facing one another). It is similar to a hanging knee raise, but with more spinal curling and a more pronounced ""crunch"" at the top.",Strength,Abdominals,Body Only,Intermediate,,

391,Single-leg curl up,"The single-leg curl up is a bodyweight abdominal movement that teaches and reinforces abdominal “bracing” for strength training.
