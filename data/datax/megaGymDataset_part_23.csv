813,Plate hammer curl,"The plate hammer curl is an exercise that targets the long head of the biceps as well as the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles.

814,Barbell spider curl,"The barbell spider curl is an exercise targeting the biceps and performed face down on either an incline bench or on the flat side of a preacher bench. The vertical bench angle helps to isolate the biceps and limit involvement of the shoulder muscles. This curl variation is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or arm-focused training.",Strength,Biceps,Other,Intermediate,,
815,Barbell forehead curl,"The barbell forehead curl is a classic movement from the Golden Age of bodybuilding and is often associated with Dave ""The Blond Bomber"" Draper. The barbell is brought up to your forehead instead of to your chest, emphasizing the squeeze and peak contraction. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set.",Strength,Biceps,Other,Intermediate,,
816,Overhead cable curl,"Also known as a crucifix curl, the overhead cable curl is a biceps-focused exercise performed between two cable stacks, using a pair of D-handles. The arms and elbows are held at shoulder height throughout the movement, and both hands curl in toward the ears. This position is designed to eliminate shoulder involvement and momentum, while targeting the biceps peak. This movement is generally done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of arm-focused training.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Intermediate,9.0,Average
817,Standing One-Arm Cable Curl,The single-arm cable biceps curl is a single-joint isolation exercise for building the biceps. This move is intended to be strict and deliberate; this is not an exercise for using momentum or otherwise cheating.,Strength,Biceps,Cable,Beginner,8.8,Average

820,Cable rope hammer curl,"The cable rope hammer curl is a popular arm-focused exercise performed with a rope handle attached by a cable to a weight stack. It uses a neutral (palms facing one another) grip, which targets the forearms and brachialis muscles in addition to the biceps. Because grip is a limitation, it is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Intermediate,8.2,Average
821,Lying cable biceps curl,"The lying cable biceps curl is a cable exercise that targets the biceps. It is performed lying on the back, either on a bench or the ground, with the feet facing toward a cable stack. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps for a burn and pump as part of an arm-focused workout.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Beginner,8.2,Average
822,Cable rope preacher hammer curl,"The cable rope preacher hammer curl is a single-joint arm exercise that builds strength and size in the biceps using a cable stack, a preacher bench, and a rope grip. The neutral or ""hammer"" grip amplifies activation of both the grip and the brachialis muscles, building arm thickness. The angle of the bench also effectively removes the shoulders from the movement, largely isolating the biceps. It is generally performed for higher reps, at least 8-15 per set.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Beginner,7.5,Average
823,Lying Close-Grip Bar Curl On High Pulley,The lying high-cable biceps curl is an unusual move for building the biceps—but it’s a highly effective one.

824,Cable EZ-Bar Preacher Curl - Gethin Variation,"The cable preacher curl is a single-joint arm exercise that builds strength and size in the biceps using a cable stack and a preacher bench. It is popular in muscle-building arm workouts because the angle of the bench effectively removes the shoulders from the movement, largely isolating the biceps. It is generally performed for higher reps, at least 8-15 per set.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Intermediate,,
825,Squatting cable EZ-bar biceps curl,"The squatting cable EZ-bar biceps curl is an exercise that builds and strengthens the biceps while the lower body is in a static squat position.

It is most similar in arm positioning to a preacher curl, but has some unique benefits to the lower body, as well.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Intermediate,,
826,Cable straight-bar biceps curl,"The cable straight-bar biceps curl takes a classic bodybuilding exercise, the standing barbell curl, and replaces the barbell with a handle attached to a cable. This is a common burnout move performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Intermediate,,
827,Standing reverse-grip cable curl,"The standing reverse-grip cable curl takes a classic bodybuilding exercise, the reverse barbell curl, and tweaks it by using a handle attached to a cable stack instead. It targets the forearm muscles and brachialis to a greater degree than underhand biceps curl variations. Because grip is a limitation, this move is commonly performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.",Strength,Biceps,Cable,Intermediate,,
828,Lying high-cable biceps curl,The lying high-cable biceps curl is a single-joint exercise targeting the biceps in a prone (face-up) position. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of the arm-focused portion of a workout.,Strength,Biceps,Cable,Intermediate,,
