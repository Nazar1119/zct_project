2530,Single-arm lateral raise,"The single-arm lateral raise is a shoulder exercise that targets the medial or middle head of the deltoid muscle. It's a staple strength-training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper-body training days. Hold on to a post for balance, or do it free-standing to challenge core strength and stability. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per side, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.1,Average

2532,Incline dumbbell reverse fly,"The incline dumbbell reverse fly is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior or rear deltoids, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.1,Average
2533,Overhead dumbbell front raise,"The overhead dumbbell front raise takes the dumbbell front raise one step further, extending the motion all the way above the head. In addition to the shoulders, it activates and strengthens the muscles of the traps and upper back. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-15 reps or more. It can be part of a dynamic upper-body warm-up, performed as a muscle-building upper-body movement, or as a burnout movement on shoulder day.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.1,Average
2534,Seated dumbbell shoulder press,"The seated dumbbell shoulder press is a popular exercise for building muscle and strength in the shoulders. The triceps also work hard in this lift. Many lifters find using dumbbells to be more comfortable and shoulder-friendly for this press variation than a barbell. This can be the primary pressing movement on an upper-body or shoulder day, or an effective accessory movement later in a workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.0,Average
2535,Alternating standing shoulder press,"The alternating standing shoulder press is a popular dumbbell exercise targeting the shoulders. It can be performed in strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.0,Average
2536,Single-arm incline rear delt raise,"The single-arm incline rear delt raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the posterior deltoids or shoulder muscles, as well as the postural muscles of the upper back. Training each side independently can help correct imbalances in size, strength, and shoulder stability. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.0,Average
2537,Alternating dumbbell front raise,"The alternating dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. Performing the movement one shoulder at a time gives a momentary rest to each side while the other is working, potentially allowing you to do more reps during each set. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.0,Average
2538,Alternating Deltoid Raise,The dumbbell front raise to lateral raise combines two exercises that build and strengthen the middle deltoids and the anterior deltoids of the shoulders.,Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.0,Average
2539,Single-dumbbell front raise,"The single-dumbbell front raise is an isolation movement that targets the shoulders. In particular, it focuses on the anterior or front head of the deltoid muscles. By performing it with one dumbbell at a time, you can focus on each shoulder muscle independently and try to address muscular imbalances between shoulders. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,9.0,Average
2540,Arnold press,"Named after the iconic bodybuilder and movie star, the Arnold press adds rotation to a classic shoulder press. It allows the hands to rotate naturally, while also hitting all three heads of the deltoids in one motion. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.9,Average
2541,Single-arm standing shoulder press,"The single-arm standing shoulder press is a popular exercise to build size and strength the shoulders and triceps. Most lifters find they can go heavier (per arm) on this movement than if they are pressing two dumbbells simultaneously, making it an effective strength movement as well as a muscle-building movement in higher reps.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.8,Average
2542,Dumbbell front raise,"The dumbbell front raise is a single-joint exercise targeting the shoulder muscles, particularly the front or anterior deltoids. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body or shoulder-focused workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.8,Average
2543,Bent-over dumbbell rear delt row,"The bent-over dumbbell rear delt row is a popular upper-body exercise that targets the muscles on the backside of the shoulder joint, specifically the medial and rear heads of the deltoid. Since pressing movements build the front and (to a lesser degree) side deltoid heads, this move is often done to promote balanced shoulder development. It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.7,Average
2544,Incline dumbbell front raise,"The incline dumbbell front raise is an upper-body exercise targeting the shoulders. Because it is performed face down on an angled bench, it has a greater range of motion than standing or upright-seated raises and hits the shoulders from a different angle. Raise variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or shoulder-focused training.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.7,Average
2545,Side Lateral Raise,"The dumbbell lateral raise is an upper body isolation exercise for building shoulder strength and muscle. It's a staple strength training move and is a great option for accessory work on upper body training days. This exercise particularly focuses on the lateral or medial head of the deltoid, making them appear wider and more developed.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.6,Average
2546,Dumbbell external shoulder rotation,"The dumbbell external shoulder rotation is a lightweight dumbbell exercise intended to maintain the health of the shoulder joints, including the rotator cuffs. It is often used as a warm-up or prehab for a shoulder or chest-focused workout with lots of pressing.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.5,Average
2547,Single-arm incline lateral raise,"The single-arm incline lateral raise is an exercise targeting the lateral or medial head of the shoulder muscles. It is performed lying sideways on an incline bench set to around 45 degrees, which helps to increase the range of motion in the lift and enforce strict form. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.5,Average
2548,Seated rear delt fly,"The seated rear delt fly is an upper-body exercise that targets the real deltoid of the shoulder. By performing the movement seated, it eliminates momentum from the rest of the body. This movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout.",Strength,Shoulders,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.4,Average
