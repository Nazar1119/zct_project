1621,Weighted back extension,"The weighted back extension is an exercise targeting the spinal erectors, as well as the glutes and hamstrings. Back extensions are often done for high reps without weight, but when done with weight, they can be an excellent accessory movement for deadlift strength as well as an overall posterior-chain strength builder. Because your back is the limiting factor, it's still an exercise that is usually done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher. You can weight it with a plate or by holding a dumbbell or other weight in your hands.",Strength,Lower Back,Body Only,Intermediate,,

1633,Band-assisted chin-up,"The band-assisted chin-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with the palms facing toward the body in an underhand position, with a band looped around the feet or knees. This reduces weight and resistance at the bottom of the rep, while increasing it toward the top. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand band-assisted pull-ups.",Strength,Middle Back,Bands,Intermediate,,

1638,Reverse-grip bent-over row,"The reverse-grip bent-over row is a compound exercise used to build strength and size in both the lower and upper back. It targets nearly all of the muscles in the back, but particularly the lats, rhomboids, and lower back. It is thought to target the biceps and lats a bit more directly than overhand barbell rows.
