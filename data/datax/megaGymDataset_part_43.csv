It targets a wide range of muscles including the lats (latissimus dorsi), traps, rhomboids, and rear deltoids, as well as the biceps. The single-arm row can work well in a variety of rep-ranges, but is most popular in muscle-building workouts or as an accessory movement for strength workouts.",Strength,Lats,Cable,Intermediate,,

1494,Reverse-grip lat pull-down,"The reverse-grip lat pull-down is variation on the lat pull-down that targets the lower lats more than an overhand grip. Because the hands are relatively close together, it also increases the range of motion beyond wider-grip pull-down variations. It can be performed for low reps, such as 5-6 per set, for back strength, or for higher reps for size.",Strength,Lats,Machine,Intermediate,8.5,Average
1495,Machine seated row,"The machine seated row is a popular exercise targeting the back muscles, particularly the lats (latissimus dorsi), rhomboids, and middle and lower trapezius. There is a wide variety of seated row machines, but most of them approximate the motion of a free-weight row, but in an upright, forward-facing position. Machine row variations are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of an upper-body or back-focused portion of a workout.",Strength,Lats,Machine,Beginner,8.4,Average
1496,Machine-assisted pull-up,"The machine-assisted pull-up takes a classic back-building exercise and adds assistance to make the movement easier than the bodyweight version. The amount of assistance can easily be changed by moving the pin in the stack. While some people use this variation as a substitute for pull-ups or as an assistance exercise for pull-ups, it is also effective as a way to perform the pull-up motion in traditional muscle-building ranges. This variation is often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or back-focused training.",Strength,Lats,Machine,Beginner,8.2,Average
1497,Single-arm pull-down,"The single-arm pull-down is a variation on the lat pull-down that is performed one arm at a time, usually with a D-shaped handle and a cable stack.

1499,Single-arm machine high row,"The single-arm machine high row is a machine-based exercise targeting the back muscles, including the lats, rhomboids, and middle and lower traps. It approximates the motion of a free-weight row, but uses a selectorized weight-stack or plate-loaded machine. Many such machines also allow you to choose between different grips and grip widths. Machine-based rows are often done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or back-focused portion of a workout.",Strength,Lats,Machine,Intermediate,,
