Weighted sit-up variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the core-focused portion of a workout.",Strength,Abdominals,Barbell,Intermediate,8.5,Average
98,Pallof press,"The Pallof press is an isometric exercise that trains core stability. It involves resisting rotation from a cable or band, developing what is sometimes called ""anti-rotation"" core strength. It is most often seen in programs for athletes who compete in sports that test strength, power, and functional movements. It can be trained in timed holds or for reps by pressing the cable or band away from the body.",Strength,Abdominals,Other,Intermediate,8.4,Average
