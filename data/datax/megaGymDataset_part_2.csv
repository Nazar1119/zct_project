28,Two-way swing,"The two-way kettlebell swing is an exercise that alternates a chest-height kettlebell swing (sometimes called a ""Russian"" or ""hardstyle"" swing) with an overhead kettlebell swing (sometimes called an ""American"" swing).

This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training.
