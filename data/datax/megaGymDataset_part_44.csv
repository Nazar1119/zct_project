1517,Negative pull-up,"The negative pull-up is a multijoint bodyweight exercise that focuses on just one half of the traditional pull-up: the lowering, eccentric, or ""negative"" portion. Because muscles are stronger eccentrically than they are concentrically, many people can perform negatives even if they can't perform full pull-ups. For this reason, it is a popular training tool to help people earn their first pull-up rep, or as a back-off exercise after doing full pull-ups.",Strength,Lats,Body Only,Intermediate,0.0,Average
1518,Chin-Up,"The a chin-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with the palms facing toward the body, in an underhand position, with a grip that is narrower than shoulder-width. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand pull-ups. It can be used as a more shoulder-friendly alternative to straight-bar pull-ups, or to help perform more reps than you can perform overhand.",Strength,Lats,Body Only,Intermediate,,

1523,Jump to pull-up,"The jump to pull-up is a bodyweight exercise that targets the muscles of the back, biceps, and, to a lesser degree, legs. It involves jumping up to a pull-up bar between reps. Similar to a push-press, the legs help power through the most difficult portion of the pull-up, allowing you to perform more reps. Jumping pull-ups are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as an accessory to other pulling or pull-up training, or as a full-body movement in a circuit or metcon.",Strength,Lats,Body Only,Intermediate,,

1537,Lower back SMR,"Lower back self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other ""trigger point"" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the quadratus lumborum or spinal erector (erector spinae) muscles of the lower back, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight area to relax or ""release."" Lower back SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the glutes or piriformis muscles, or by stretches that target the piriformis or hips. However, some people find that SMR on the lower back can aggravate existing pain or injury, so be cautious when performing it.",Stretching,Lower Back,Foam Roll,Intermediate,4.5,Average
1538,Barbell deficit deadlift,"The barbell deficit deadlift is a compound exercise targeting the posterior chain. It is commonly utilized in powerlifting training to build pulling strength off the floor, but is also an effective muscle-building movement for the glutes and hamstrings. It is usually performed with lighter weight, and perhaps for higher reps, than traditional deadlifts. If these make your back sore, decrease the deficit and/or wear a weightlifting belt.",Powerlifting,Lower Back,Barbell,Beginner,9.4,Average

1547,TBS Good Morning,"The barbell good morning is an exercise that targets glute, hamstring, and lower back development. It is often trained as an accessory movement to the deadlift, but also has value on its own. It is sometimes performed for reps in traditional strength-focused rep ranges such as 5-8 reps per set, but due to the risk posed to the lower back, is rarely treated as a max-effort single-rep lift.",Strength,Lower Back,Barbell,Intermediate,,

When the feet are wide and the hands are inside the knees, it is a sumo deadlift.",Strength,Lower Back,Barbell,Intermediate,,
