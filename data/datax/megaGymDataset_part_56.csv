1917,Dumbbell Lunges,"The dumbbell split squat is a popular lower-body exercise to build strength and muscle one leg at a time.

1918,Dumbbell reverse lunge,"The dumbbell reverse lunge is a popular lower-body movement that targets the muscles of the quads, glutes, hamstrings, and hips. It also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves.

If this movement hurts your knees, try performing split squats instead.",Strength,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.7,Average

1920,Dumbbell sumo squat,"The dumbbell sumo squat is a popular lower-body movement using a single dumbbell held in front of the legs. It is performed with a wider than shoulder-width stance, which increases the demand on the glutes, hamstrings, and adductors while still benefiting the quads, core, and upper body. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout.",Strength,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.3,Average
1921,Dumbbell seated box jump,"The dumbbell seated box jump is an explosive exercise that builds the quadriceps as well as overall lower-body strength and explosiveness. All you need is a box, a bench, and a light dumbbell. Performing it from a seated position eliminates the stretch reflex in the lower body, forcing you to generate more power. This is an advanced move, so consider starting off with box jumps or squat jumps before progressing to this.",Plyometrics,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.3,Average
1922,Dumbbell step-up,"The dumbbell step-up is a great exercise for building lower-body strength and power. It targets all the same muscles as bodyweight step-ups, such as the quads, glutes, and hamstrings, but allows for greater muscular overload.",Strength,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,Intermediate,8.2,Average

1926,Dumbbell front squat,"The dumbbell front squat is a popular exercise for targeting the muscles of the lower body, including the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance.",Strength,Quadriceps,Dumbbell,Intermediate,0.0,

1929,Dumbbell lunge with biceps curl,"The dumbbell lunge with biceps curl combines an isometric hold at the bottom of a lunge with a dumbbell biceps curl.
