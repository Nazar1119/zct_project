2027,Single-leg knee-tap squat,"The single-leg knee-tap squat is a single-leg squat variation that involves “floating” the back leg over the ground on the descent until touching just the knee to the ground or a pad. It is similar to a lunge, but without touching the back foot to the ground.

2032,Hybrid deadlift,"The hybrid deadlift is a version of the barbell deadlift in which the lifter's stance is wider than a conventional position, but narrower than a wide sumo deadlift. The feet are just outside the shoulders and grip placement is just inside of the legs. Many non-competitive lifters find this position to be more spine friendly and strong than either of the other traditional stances. This variation of the deadlift has all the same benefits as the others, and is capable of building serious full-body and posterior chain strength.",Strength,Quadriceps,Other,Intermediate,,

It can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges or for higher reps.",Strength,Quadriceps,Other,Intermediate,,
