611,Bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction,"The bent-knee Copenhagen hip adduction is an advanced exercise that combines the isometric stabilization of the Copenhagen plank with dynamic adductions to challenge the core stabilizers and adductors.

642,Feet-elevated crunch,"The feet-elevated crunch is a variation on the basic crunch, a very popular ab move. Resting the feet on a bench takes some of the hip flexor activation out of the movement, focusing the stress more on the abs.
